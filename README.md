This is the `solution` branch of this repo. It contains the end result of following the [Spring Boot externalized Configuration](https://kubebyexample.com/en/learning-paths/<<NEED_TO_FILL_THIS_IN>>) lesson for the [Developing with Spring Boot on Kubernetes](https://kubebyexample.com/en/learning-paths/developing-spring-boot-kubernetes) learning path on [kube by example](https://kubebyexample.com).

This project was generated using [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io). The [`HelloController`](src/main/java/org/acme/externalconfig/rest/HelloController.java) and [`HelloControllerTests`](src/test/java/org/acme/externalconfig/rest/HelloControllerTests.java) classes were added as a starting point for the lesson.
